<div class="info">
	I am a junior at Millersville University of Pennsylvania majoring in Interactive and Graphic Design. I have yet to find a type of design I dislike, but I particularly enjoy logo design and working in Adobe AfterEffects for motion design.
<br>
<br>
	Patterns and puns are my greatest inspirations for design. I like working abstractly and seeing where my mind takes me, and making patterns in Adobe Illustrator was the way I did that while familiarizing myself with the software.
<br>
<br>
	Finding multiple meanings to a word or prompt is a great starting point that can create the fun visual elements for a design. Professional work may not always call for fun, but approaching a mundane project with humor can lead to creative decisions.
<br>
<br>
	The works below are a mix of class projects and personal projects.

<h2>Logos</h2>

		<b>Class prompt:</b> Design a logo based on an animal
<br>
<br>
		I chose an electric eel and used a lightening bolt as the motif. Magneel makes shockingly good microwaves.
		</div>
		<img src="images/magneel.jpg" style="width: 400px;"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="box">
		<div id="logok">
		<b>Class prompt:</b> Design a logo based on a fruit
<br>
<br>
		I chose a key lime as my fruit and I decided a key smith would be fitting. The shape of a lime mirrors the shape of the top a key, so I worked with the silhouette of the lime to make a key for the logo
		</div>
		<div class="logo"><img src="images/Klime's.jpg" style="width: 400px;"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="box">
		<div id="logov">
		<b>Class prompt:</b> Design a logo based on a plant
<br>
<br>
		I chose a lily pad as my plant. After doing research on the plant and what its shape reminds me of, I settled on an umbrella company. Velari means a type of awning or covering.
		</div>
		<div class="logo"><img src="images/Velari.jpg" style="width: 400px;"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="box">
		<div id="logoc">
		<b>Class prompt:</b> Design a logo based on a vegetable.
<br>
<br>
		I chose cellery as my vegetable. My ideas stemmed from the homophone of 'cell' and 'sell'. The stringy texture of the cellery represents a bar graph. Cellers would be a stock market consultanting business.
		</div>
		<div class="logo"><img src="images/Cellers.jpg" style="width: 400px;"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="box">
		<div id="logot">
		I made this logo after hearing 'subtlety' as 'subtle tea'. I like designs that are minimalistic and don't have overwhelming branding. The light-weight typeface and tea leaf on the edge of the y are subtle while showing that the company sells green tea.
		</div>
		<div class="logo"><img src="images/tea.jpg" style="width: 400px;"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="box">
		<div id="logoa">
		<b>Class prompt:</b> Design a logo based on a mineral
<br>
<br>
		I chose aquamarine as my mineral. I had the loosest approach with this logo as the mineral itself did not give me many ideas, but seperating ‘aqua’ and ‘marine’ sparked the idea of a submarine company. The Saturn logo, bubble with a ring, inspired the name to be Aquarn. The company would make submarines that look like spaceships.

	<h2 style="margin-left: 0px;">Poem Book</h2>
	This poem book was made spring semester of my sophmore year in an illustration course.
<br>
<br>
	I wrote this short poem in a an introduction to web programming course my freshman year. I revisited it after hearing the prompt to illustrate a story, lyric, or poem. The illustration was done in Illustrator. I experimented with texture to elevate the flat graphics.

	This video was made spring semester of my sophmore year in a motion design course.
<br>
<br>
	I worked on this with a partner to explain how honey bees make honey. We decided on a graphic style and used storyboards for planning before animating it in Aftereffects.
